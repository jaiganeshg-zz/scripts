# Synonyms
While stemming helps to broaden the scope of search by simplifying inflected words to their root form, synonyms broaden the scope by relating concepts and ideas. Perhaps no documents match a query for “English queen,” but documents that contain “British monarch” would probably be considered a good match.

A user might search for “the US” and expect to find documents that contain United States, USA, U.S.A., America, or the States. However, they wouldn’t expect to see results about the states of matter or state machines.
